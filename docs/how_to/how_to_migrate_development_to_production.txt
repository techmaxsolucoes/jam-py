How to migrate development to production
========================================

Migrating development to production is very simple in Jam.py due to the ability 
to export and import its metadata. 

To understand the concept of metadata and the process of exporting and importing 
metadata, please read the topic 
:doc:`Export/import metadata </admin/project/metadata_file>`.
The process of importing metadata depends on the type of project database.

New project migration
=====================

* Create an empty database in the production environment

* Run *jam-project.py* script to create a new project

* Set up the server. See 
  
  * :doc:`Jam.py deployment with Apache and mod_wsgi </intro/deployment>`,
  * :doc:`How to deploy <deploy/index>`.

* In the browser start the Application Builder and finish the creation of the 
  project with an empty database.

* open 
  :doc:`Parameters </admin/project/parameters>` dialog to set up the project. 
  Setup the following parameters:
  
  * **Production** to true
  
  * **Safe mode**
  
  * **Debugging** to false

* Export the metadata of the development project to a zip file 
  in the Application Builder by clicking the 
  :doc:`Export </admin/project/export>` button.
  
* Import the metadata to the new project.

.. note::

    For projects with **SQLite** database you can simply copy the development 
    project folder to the production environment.

Existing project migration
==========================

* Export the metadata of the development project to a zip file. 

* Import the metadata to the production project.

.. note::

    For **SQLite** database, Jam.py doesnâ€™t support importing of metadata into an 
    existing project (project with tables in the database). 
    You can only import metadata into a new project.


Importing metadata with server shutdown
=======================================

Stop the server and copy the metadata zip file to *migration* folder in the 
project directory. If the folder doesn't exist, create it.

Start the server. The web application, while initializing itself, will
import the metadata file. You can see the information on how the file was 
imported in the log file in the *logs* folder of the project directory.
If the import is successful, the zip file will be deleted.

Importing metadata without server shutdown
==========================================

Click the 
:doc:`Import </admin/project/import>`
button in the Application Builder.

.. note::

   By default the web application in the process that imports the metadata waits 
   for 5 minutes or until all previous request to the application in 
   **this process** will be processed before it starts to change the database. 
   For projects that run on multiple processes you can set the **Import delay** 
   parameter in the
   :doc:`Parameters </admin/project/parameters>` 
   to delay the change the database or
   use Importing metadata with server shutdown.
