Can I use other libraries in my application
===========================================

You can add javascript libraries to use them for programming on the client side.

It is better to place them in the *js* folders of the *static* directory of the 
project. And refer to them using the src attribute in the <script> tag of the
:doc:`Index.html </programming/interface/index_html>`
file.

For example, :doc:`Demo project </intro/demo_project>` uses Chart.js library to 
create a dashboard:

.. code-block:: html

    <script src="/static/js/Chart.min.js"></script>

On the server side you can import python libraries to your modules. 

For example the mail item server module import smtplib library to send emails:

.. code-block:: py

    import smtplib
