Customizing Forms
=================

When we refresh the project page, we see that fields in the table and
in the edit form of the "Contacts" journal are displayed in the order in which 
they were created.

To change how fields are displayed in the table, click the **View Form** 
button to open the
:doc:`View Form Dialog </admin/items/view_form_dialog>`.
Let's change the displayed fields using **left**, **right**, **up** 
and **down** buttons.

In the example above, we have hidden the "firstname" field by selecting it and
pressing the **right** arrow button, and we have moved the "notes" field to be
last by selecting it and pressing the **down** button.

We can also change which fields can be used for sorting the table.
To do this, click on the button right to the **Sort fields** input and select the
corresponding column header of the table. Then save all changes by pressing **OK**.

To change the way the fields are displayed in the edit form, click the **Edit Form**
button to open the
:doc:`Edit Form Dialog </admin/items/edit_form_dialog>`.
This works in a very similar way to the **View Form** above.

To see the result of our work, go to the project page, refresh it and click
the **New** button.
