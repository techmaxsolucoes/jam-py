===========
New project
===========

We'll assume that jam.py is already installed. If not, see 
:doc:`Installation </intro/install>`
guide how to do it.

First create a folder for the new project. In this folder, execute the
``jam-project.py`` script to create the project structure.

.. code-block:: console

    $ jam-project.py

After that, run the ``server.py`` script that ``jam-project.py`` created:

.. code-block:: console

    $ ./server.py

Now, to complete the creation of the project, open the web browser and go to 

.. code-block:: console

    127.0.0.1:8080/builder.html

to open the Application Builder. You should see the language selection dialog.

Use the browse button to select **English**, and click the **OK** button.
The project parameters dialog box appears.

Fill out the form as in the picture above, and click **OK**.
Now you should see the project tree in the left panel.

Open a new page, type

.. code-block:: console

	127.0.0.1:8080

in the address bar and press Enter.
A new project appears with an empty menu.
